<h3>This repo contains notable projects from my Data Structure class</h3>
<br>
<h2>Labs </h2>
<b> Lab 7: </b>
<p> This lab contains a custom-built implementation of a Binary Search Tree,
    containing methods for preorder, inorder, and postorder traversal as well as
    methods for node removal </p>
<b>Lab 8:</b>
<p> This lab contains implementations of quicksort, heapsort, and mergesort </p>
<h2>Projects / Programs </h2>
<b> Project 1: </b>
<p> This project involves a custom-built implementation of the STL singly-linked list.
    The main class is a called MovieChart.
    A MovieChart has a list of User objects.
    Each user has basic personal information as well as a list of movies.
    The driver code in <code>program1.cpp</code> allows a user to add and remove User objects
    as well as update their information</p>
<b>Project 2: </b>
<p> This project uses a custom-built implementation of the STL heap as a max
    priority queue. The program plays a game of "high card," where the winner is
    the player with the highest card. The driver code in <code>program2.cpp</code>
    reads in players from file and then plays a tournament. Losers are put back on
    the heap if they have enough money for the next round. The game continues until
    the heap is empty </p>
<b>Project 3: </b>
<p> This project involves the use of the Graph data structure. The graph is
    implemented as a series of adjacency lists in order for the project to utilize
    for data structures. The project  uses dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to
    find the shortest path between cities that are read in from a file </p>
