<h3> This repo contains notable projects from my Data Structure class</h3>
<br>
<h2> Project 1 </h2>
<p> This project involves a custom-built implementation of the STL singly-linked list.
    The main class is a called MovieChart.
    A MovieChart has a list of User objects.
    Each user has basic personal information as well as a list of movies.
    The driver code in <code>program1.cpp</code> allows a user to add and remove User objects
    as well as update their information</p>
<h2> Project 2 </h2>
<p> This project uses a custom-built implementation of the STL heap as a max priority queue. The program plays a game of "high card," where the winner is the player with the highest card. The driver code in <code>program2.cpp</code> reads in players from file and then plays a tournament. Losers are put back on the heap if they have enough money for the next round. The game continues until the heap is empty </p>
